				I am a student at UC Berkeley.  Originally from Pittsburgh, PA, I have lived in Pittsburgh, Yemin Orde Youth Village (near Haifa, Israel), Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Berkeley.
			</p>
			<p>
				I made my first website to show off my Lego creations; it has since disappeared.  I hope at some point to include a bonus page with all of my old Lego creations, for, uh, reasons.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I've been building ever since.

				Before moving to Berkeley I taught English in Israel for a year to Ethiopian, Russian, Brazilian, and Israeli students.  I learned how scarily influential American pop culture is when Ethiopian students came up to me and started quoting Tupac.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am interested in lots of things, from computer science and hacking to learning new languages to playing and listening to music to making coffee.  I'm always looking for fun ways to combine these things.
