			<p>
				I am a student at UC Berkeley.  Originally from Pittsburgh, PA, I have lived in Pittsburgh, Yemin Orde Youth Village (near Haifa, Israel), Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Berkeley.
			</p>
			<p>
				I made my first website to show off my Lego creations, it has since disappeared.  I hope at some point to include a bonus page with all of my old Lego creations, for, uh, reasons.  
			</p>
			<p>
			I've been building ever since.
			</p>
			<p>
				Before moving to Berkeley I taught English in Israel for a year to Ethiopian, Russian, Brazilian, and Israeli students.  I learned how scarily influential American pop culture is when Ethiopian students came up to me and started quoting Tupac.
			</p>
			<p>
				I am interested in lots of things, from computer science and hacking to learning new languages to playing and listening to music to making coffee.  I'm always looking for fun ways to combine these things.

			For a class I took at Berkeley on the US Prison Industrial Complex, as a final project I created a geographical rendering of the United States to show the distribution of prisoners across the country.
		</p>
		<p>
			I remember one day walking out of my prison discussion and I heard someone describe the prison industrial complex as an ugly wound on America.  I found this to be particularly interesting as an artistic statement.  So I made a map.  I was inspired by <a href="http://joshbegley.com/">Josh Begley</a>'s work on taking data on the prisons and making a visual representation, and so I expanded on it.  I found the location of every single federal prison - I had wanted to include state and local incarceral spaces but the data is simply unavailable or extremeley inaccessible in many parts - and I wrote a program that maps each federal incarceral space based on the number of human souls it contains.
		</p>  
		<p>
			What happens next is stunning.  I changed my code slightly so that in order to actually see the United States, and see a physical representation of the wounds inflicted, one must, at least briefly, acknowledge the prisoners held within, and acknowledge their existence.  In order to see what the United States really looks like with all of the wounds and disease that is the prison industrial complex, one must first acknowledge the human souls it contains.
